# Experiment with data from Starbucks

## Project Motivation
The goal of this project is to analyze this ranodmized dataset provided by Starbucks to see if handed promotions lead to an increase in purchases.

The data was split into training and test data. Each unique receipient can also be categorized with seven unique groups V1 to V7.

There are two main questions to answer:
1. Analyze the results of the experiment to identify the possible effect on purchases and Net Incremental Revenue
2. Build a model to identify the best customers to target with promotions to maximize the Incremental Response Rate and Net Incremental Revenue.


## Getting Started
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Dependencies
- pandas and numpy for data wrangling
- sklearn for training model
- itertools to print out every possible combination of data

### File Descriptions
- Starbucks.ipynb: Python notebook to analyze the experiment results and train a model to maximize metrics
- test_results.py: Python file to test the result of the model against the solution from Udacity
- The training and test data

### Installation
Aside from a working installation of python, there is no further installation needed.
